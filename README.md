# VMware vSphere Nested ESXi Environment - Deployed by automatically installing the ISO and configuring via KS.CFG file (kickstart file)

This playbook will deploy one or many nested ESXi hosts on to your physical ESXi vSphere host. The purpose is to create a nested esxi environment for various purposes. In my case, for deploying a VCF environment. To see more details, please see my blog post: https://mattadam.com/2024/01/09/deploy-nested-esxi-vms-using-a-kickstart-ks-script-and-ansible-automation/

## Variables
/vars/creds.yaml - There's a few variables to set in the creds file for this script to work.  
Note that the networks need to be portgroups that are created on your physical ESXi host's switch.
```
nested_info: # This is a list of the ESXI VMs that you want to create, add more or remove some as necessary
  - name: vcf-mgmt-esxi-1 # VM name
    staticip: 192.168.3.16 # Static IP address of the VM
    fqdn: vcf-mgmt-esxi-1.home.lab # FQDN, used for setting the hostname, and certificate generation
  - name: vcf-mgmt-esxi-2
    staticip: 192.168.3.17

/hosts - Not a required file. No need to update.

/roles/deployesxi/tasks/main.yaml - There's a few variables to set in the creds file for this script to work

```
datacenter: ha-datacenter - Modify this to your datacenter name. If no vCenter is deployed managing the physical host, leave ha-datacenter
path: "ISOs/{{ nested_info.name }}.iso" - This requires a folder called "ISOs" to exist in your root directory of the datacenter. Modify it as needed.
```

## Usage
It is recommended that you always use an encrypted vault. The creds.yaml file needs to be encrypted.

To run the playbook:
```
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False; ansible-playbook main.yaml -i hosts
```
